## Cryptography and Coding theory

This repo was created originally for code submissions for the class "Coding Theory" at the University of Szeged. It has 2 different projects:
  - error_correction:
    - Basic Hamming code and extended Golay code encoder, channel/noise generator, and syndrome decoder.
    - Works for arbitrary field, on codes given by (i) systematic generator matrix and (ii) field description
  - rsa:
    - Efficient RSA implementation in C, multiprocessing lib (GMP)
    - Only using basic arithmetic operations
    - Contains RSA keygenerator for arbitrary key length and message encoder, decoder
